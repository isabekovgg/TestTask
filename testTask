   1) How would you handle a StaleElementReferenceException? Please provide a
   code fragment or fragments, if you know about several common ways of handling.
   
   //1st way just to refresh page and find refreshed element

    //2nd way to use try catch, and wait till element will refresh and appear in dom
   
   async waitForElement(locator){
        let stateElement = true

        while(stateElement){
            try{
                await this.driver.wait(until.elementLocated(locator), expectedTimeout)
                stateElement = false
            } catch(e){
                stateElement = true
            }
        }
    }
    //3rd way to use ExpectedConditions of Selenium WebDriver as presenceOfElement or refreshed
    //4th use waitForElement
    
    if it's in terms of selenide, usually it handles all of this stuff by itself
    However, there may be problems with Lists, because Selenide using snapshot() method for iterations
    it could be solved like:
    
    int i = 0;
      for (SelenideElement item : list) {
        list.get(i).click();//using get refreshes the list
        index++;
      }
    
    2) Call https://freegeoip.app/json/ API and perform the following actions:
    a) Assert the response code;
    b) Parse the response;
    c) Assert your latitude and longitude with a 0.01° tolerance (assume you know
    your actual lat and lon).
    
    val response = our_response
    
    a)
      int statusCode = response.getStatusCode();
      Assert.assertEquals(statusCode, 200, "Verify that status code equals '200'");
    or
      .getResponse
      .verify("Verify that status code equals '200'", s ->
        s.getStatusCode().shoulBe(equal(200))
      );
    
    b)
      val body = response.getBody();
      val parse = JSON.parse(body);
    
    c)
      .parse
      .verify("verify that lat and long are correct with tolerance of 0.01", s -> {
        s.data.location.latitude.sizeLessThan(knownValue+0.01);
        s.data.location.latitude.sizeMoreThan(knownValue-0.01);
        s.data.location.longitude.sizeLessThan(knownValue+0.01);
        s.data.location.longitude.sizeMoreThan(knownValue-0.01);
      });
    
    3) Provide a code fragment that switches the current browser to another tab
    (consider there are only 2 tabs). Please comment on the code in detail
    
    if we are using selenide it's just:
    switchTo(tab_name)//swithcing by tab name
    or
    switchTo(1)//switching to the tab by index
    but if we use raw selenium it should be something like:

    ArrayList<String> tabsList = new ArrayList<String> (driver.getWindowHandles());
    driver.switchTo(tabsList.get(1));//also using index to access second tab
    
    And most straightforward way is to use js Actions selenide/selenium:
    
    actions().sendKeys(Keys.CONTROL,Keys.TAB).perform()
    
    new Actions(driver).sendKeys(Keys.chord(Keys.CONTROL, Keys.TAB)).perform();
    //because it's only two tabs we can also use combination CONTROL+SHIFT+TAB
    
    4) Imagine the following scenario: you click on a button that should redirect you to a
    new page, but the page URL stays the same and the DOM structure stays almost
    the same. Provide a code fragment to wait explicitly for the page to unload. Waiting
    for the page to load is not necessary (perhaps you want to gracefully handle some
    errors in case you are left on the same page).
    
    Very interesting and tricky task, never happened in my practice, but I think this code should work:
    
    WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(myDriver, Duration.ofSeconds(expected_timeout));
    wait.until(webDriver -> "loading".equals(((JavascriptExecutor) webDriver)
      .executeScript("return document.readyState")));
    //document.readyState has 3 states:
    //complete = when all of the content on the page is loaded and interactible
    //interactive = when u can interact with page, but not everything loaded as images, etc.
    //loading = when DOM is still loading
